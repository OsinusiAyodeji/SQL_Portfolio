# üìä Maven Sales Pipeline Analysis

## üéØ Executive Summary

Using advanced SQL techniques including **CTEs, window functions, and complex joins**, I analyzed MavenTech's complete sales pipeline to identify performance gaps and revenue opportunities.

* Examined **8,800+ sales opportunities** across products, agents, and accounts
* Found top-performing agents achieve **85% win rates** vs. underperformers at **45%**
* The **GTX Plus Pro** product line drives **60% more revenue per deal** than average
* Recommendations: targeted coaching + resource reallocation could boost pipeline efficiency by **15‚Äì20%**

---

## üöÄ Key Recommendations

1. üë• Implement sales coaching program for underperforming agents
2. üì¶ Increase marketing focus on high-converting products (GTX series)
3. üåç Reallocate resources to top-performing regional offices
4. üè¢ Develop account management strategy for high-value parent companies

## üéØ Business Problem

MavenTech‚Äôs VP of Sales needed deeper insights into team performance to identify strengths and weaknesses across the sales organization.

While overall performance seemed solid, there was limited visibility into:

* Which agents and managers were top performers vs. needing coaching
* What products had the highest win rates and revenue potential
* How well key accounts and subsidiaries were managed
* Where in the process the most opportunities were lost

---

## ‚ùì Key Questions

* Which sales agents and managers are top performers vs. need coaching?
* What products have the highest win rates and revenue potential?
* Are we effectively managing our key accounts and subsidiaries?
* Where in our sales process are we losing the most opportunities?

    ROUND(AVG(CASE WHEN deal_stage = 'Won' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) * 100, 2) AS win_rate_percent,
    RANK() OVER (ORDER BY AVG(CASE WHEN deal_stage = 'Won' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) DESC) AS performance_rank
