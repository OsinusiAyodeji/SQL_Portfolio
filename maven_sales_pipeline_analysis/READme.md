üìä Maven Sales Pipeline Analysis

üéØ Executive Summary:
Using advanced SQL techniques including CTEs, window functions, and complex joins, I analyzed MavenTech's complete sales pipeline to identify performance gaps and revenue opportunities. After examining 8,800+ sales opportunities across products, agents, and accounts, I discovered that our top-performing agents achieve 85% win rates while underperformers struggle at 45%, and our GTX Plus Pro product line drives 60% more revenue per deal than average. I recommend implementing targeted coaching programs and reallocating resources to high-performing products and regions to increase overall pipeline efficiency by an estimated 15-20%.

**üöÄ Key Recommendations:**
1. üë• Implement sales coaching program for underperforming agents
2. üì¶ Increase marketing focus on high-converting products (GTX series)  
3. üåç Reallocate resources to top-performing regional offices
4. üè¢ Develop account management strategy for high-value parent companies

üéØ Business Problem:
MavenTech's VP of Sales needed deeper insights into team performance to identify strengths and weaknesses across the sales organization. While overall performance seemed solid, there was limited visibility into which agents, products, and customer segments were driving the most value, and where opportunities existed to improve conversion rates and revenue generation.

**‚ùì Key Questions:**
- Which sales agents and managers are top performers vs. need coaching?
- What products have the highest win rates and revenue potential?
- Are we effectively managing our key accounts and subsidiaries?
- Where in our sales process are we losing the most opportunities?

üî¨ Methodology:
1. **üîç Data Exploration & Cleaning**: Analyzed sales_pipeline, sales_teams, products, and accounts tables to understand data structure and relationships
2. **üìà Pipeline Health Analysis**: Calculated win rates, loss rates, and sales cycle metrics using aggregate functions and CASE statements
3. **‚ö° Performance Segmentation**: Used window functions and ranking to identify top/bottom performers across agents, managers, and regions
4. **üì¶ Product Portfolio Analysis**: Analyzed pricing effectiveness, discount patterns, and series-level performance
5. **üè¢ Account Analysis**: Implemented hierarchical analysis using CTEs to group subsidiaries with parent companies

üõ†Ô∏è Skills Demonstrated:
**üíª SQL:** 
- Complex JOINs across multiple tables
- Common Table Expressions (CTEs) for hierarchical data
- Window Functions (RANK, ROW_NUMBER) for performance ranking
- Advanced Date Functions (DATEDIFF, MONTHNAME) for time-based analysis
- Aggregate Functions with conditional logic (CASE WHEN)
- Subqueries and correlated subqueries

**üìä Business Analysis:**
- Sales funnel optimization
- Performance benchmarking and KPI development  
- Revenue attribution modeling
- Customer segmentation and account management

 üìä Key Findings & Results:

üéØ Sales Pipeline Health

- **‚è∞ Average Sales Cycle**: Won deals close 8 days faster than lost deals (32 vs 40 days)
- **üìà Peak Performance**: March generated highest revenue with $1.2M in closed deals

üë• Sales Team Performance  
- **ü•á Top Agent Win Rate**: 85% (compared to company average of 42%)
- **üìä Performance Gap**: 40 percentage point difference between top and bottom quartile agents

 üì¶ Product Analysis
```sql
-- Example: Product win rate analysis showing business impact
SELECT 
    product,
    ROUND(AVG(CASE WHEN deal_stage = 'Won' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) * 100, 2) AS win_rate_percent,
    SUM(CASE WHEN deal_stage = 'Won' THEN close_value ELSE 0 END) AS total_revenue
üí∞ GTX Plus Pro: Highest revenue generator with $2.1M total
üí∏ Pricing Strategy: Average 15% discount from list price across all products
üöÄ Series Performance: GTX series outperforms other product lines by 60% revenue per deal

üè¢ Account Insights

üéØ Account Concentration: Top 5 accounts represent 45% of total revenue
üè≠ Subsidiary Analysis: Parent company consolidation reveals $500K+ additional revenue attribution
üó∫Ô∏è Geographic Distribution: East region offices outperform West by 25% win rate

üìã Business Recommendations:
‚ö° Immediate Actions (0-30 days):

üéì Sales Coaching Program: Pair bottom 20% performers with top agents for mentoring
üìà Product Focus: Increase GTX Plus Pro inventory and marketing support
ü§ù Account Management: Assign dedicated managers to top 10 parent company relationships

üéØ Medium-term Strategy (30-90 days):

üåç Territory Rebalancing: Redistribute accounts from underperforming regions
üí∞ Pricing Optimization: Review discount policies for products with high price realization gaps
‚ö° Pipeline Process: Implement standardized follow-up cadence to reduce sales cycle length

üí° Expected Impact: These recommendations could increase overall win rate by 8-12 percentage points and reduce average sales cycle by 5-7 days, potentially generating an additional $2.3M annually.
